            <h3 class="red"><strong>Game of Skill</strong></h3>
            <div class=" margin-top">Games can be broadly classified into the following two categories:</div>
            <div style="margin-left:30px;" align="justify">
              <strong>Games of chance</strong>, where the winner is determined entirely by mere luck, the result is wholly uncertain and doubtful and a human being cannot apply his/her mind to estimate the result or his/her efforts to influence the result. Generally, such games are illegal as constituting gambling.
                <p class="margin-top-10" align="justify"><strong>Games of skill,</strong> where, skill plays the dominant role and the result depends primarily upon the relative knowledge, training, attention, experience, and/or adroitness of the participants. Generally, such games are not deemed to constitute ‘gambling’ and do not fall foul of the laws prohibiting gambling.</p>
                <div align="justify"> For a game to be considered a game of skill under Indian law, the element of skill must predominate the element of chance in affecting the results of the game. Thus, the extent to which skill is involved in the game is the key factor in the determination of the nature and legality of the game under Indian law.
Accordingly, games involving knowledge and IQ from various fields to answer questions in a quiz are game of skill where winning on chance has zero probability

            <h3 class="red"><strong>Indian Law on gambling</strong></h3>
            <div style="margin-left:30px;" align="justify">
              
                <p class="margin-top-10" align="justify">The principal legislation governing gambling in India is the Public Gambling Act, 1867 (“PGA”). The PGA criminalises the act of ‘gambling’ in a public forum and the keeping of a ‘common gaming house’. The PGA, however, creates an important exception in favour of games of skill, by stating that the provisions of the PGA shall [not] be held to apply to any ‘game of mere skill’ wherever played.</p>
                <p class=" margin-top-10" align="justify">In determining whether a given game or contest is a game of skill or chance, Indian courts have adopted the standard of assessing the ‘dominant factor’ of a game. The two most important Indian cases in this regard are State of Andhra Pradesh v. K Satyanarayana (AIR 1968 SC 825) (the “Satyanarayana” case) and KR Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu (AIR 1996 SC 1153) (the “Lakshmanan” case).</p>
                <p class=" margin-top-10" align="justify">In the Satyanarayana case, the Supreme Court defined a 'game of mere skill' to mean a game "in which, although the element of chance necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated, success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness of the player." By application of this definition, the Supreme Court held that the game of rummy was a game of skill, and did not amount to gambling under the PGA. While upholding the levy of a nominal service charge for provision of a physical space, cards, etc., to play a game of rummy, the Court reasoned:</p>
                <p class=" margin-top-10" align="justify">"Rummy...... requires certain amount of skill because the fall of the cards has to be memorised and the building up of Rummy requires considerable skill in holding and discarding cards. We cannot, therefore, say that the game of Rummy is a game of entire chance. It is mainly and preponderantly a game of skill."</p>
                <p class=" margin-top-10" align="justify">In the Lakshmanan case, the Supreme Court held that the betting on horse races was a game of skill. It rationalised that in a horse race the winner is not determined by chance alone, as the condition, speed and endurance of the horse and the skill and management of the rider are factors affecting the result of the race. The bettor has the opportunity to exercise his judgment and discretion in determining the horse on which to bet.</p>
