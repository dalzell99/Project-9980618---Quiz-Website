<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rmccue/Requests/issues/121">Fix compatibility with HHVM</a> - Using HHVM with Requests would

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/rmccue/Requests/issues/23">Add multiple request support</a> - Send multiple HTTP requests with both
fsockopen and cURL, transparently falling back to synchronous when

<a href="https://requests.ryanmccue.info/docs/proxy.html">high-level API</a>. Major props to Ozh for his fantastic work
on this.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/rmccue/Requests/issues/63">Verify host name for SSL requests</a> - Requests is now the first and only

for reviewing the crucial code behind this.</p>
